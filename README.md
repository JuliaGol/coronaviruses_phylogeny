# coronaviruses_phylogeny
The first project for Introduction to computational biology
Script for phylogeny trees generation of coronaviruses: 019-nCov virus, SARS, bat coronavirus, MERS and with two other viruses for comparision: 
influenza A -  flu virus and hepatitis A virus.
This Python Script downloads viruses' genomes and spike proteins  sequences from genebank automatically (besides hepatitis A which spike proteins 
are not deposed in genebank).
The program makes four phylogenic trees: according to genome's and spike proteins sequences in two versions with nj and second with upgma approach. 
The results are in file 'trees'.
